# EMS-Simulator

EMS Simulator is an open-source software for performing ambulance dispatch simulation and analyses. It was created for the purpose of providing a general, customizable ambulance simulation framework with built-in and extendable functionality. The library aims to eliminate overhead in designing specialized simulation software and lower barrier to emergency response optimization in health organizations globally.

EMS-Simulator depends on the following libraries:
- __NumPy__, for mathmatical computation convenience
- __SciPy__, for KD Tree implementation in nearest neighbor calculation
- __Geopy__, for manipulation of spatial coordinates
- __Pandas__, for internal data manipulation and file reading
- __Pyyaml__, for loading simulation configurations from file
- __Shapely__, for manipulation of spatial polygons
