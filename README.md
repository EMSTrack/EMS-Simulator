# EMS-Simulator

EMS Simulator is an open-source software for performing ambulance dispatch simulation and analyses. It was created for the purpose of providing a general, customizable ambulance simulation framework with built-in and extendable functionality. With the usage of this library, we hope to eliminate overhead in designing specialized simulation software and lower barrier to emergency response optimization in health organizations globally.

EMS-Simulator depends on the following libraries:
- Numpy, for mathmatical computation convenience
- Scipy, for KD Tree implementation in nearest neighbor calculation
- Geopy, for manipulation of spatial coordinates
- Pandas, for internal data manipulation and file reading
- Pyyaml, for loading simulation configurations from file
- Shapely, for manipulation of spatial polygons
